This program modifies an image to cartoon images using adaptive thresholding or Canny edge detection.
Image folder provided includes six images.

Controls
- '-' key and '+' key to change image you modify.
- 'ESC' to quit the program.


Demos and limits of my program
- Image folder provided includes six images.
- In my code, using Canny edge detection is better than adaptive thresholding generating cartoon images, due to its degree of intricacy.
- Image 1 and 2 were well-modified to cartoon like images, while 3 to 6 aren't.
- My program's weakness(limit) is...
    - on modifying real human images, seperating edge between neck and head is poor.
    - poor shading preservance.
